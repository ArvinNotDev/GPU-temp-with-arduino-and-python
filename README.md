you can use this simple code to monitor your amd or nvidia GPUs temp...

you can use whatever display you want(i just used TM1637 seven segment)...

you can make different LED EFFECTS which changes by temperature...

there are 3 simple Effects for ws2812b ARGB LEDs...

you can change some code to monitor your gpu usage or gpu clock or even you can monitor
